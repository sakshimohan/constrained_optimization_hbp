# Health Benefits Package (HBP) design using linear constrained optimization
This repository contains code for the application of linear constrained optimization to design optimal and feasible health benefits packages. 

app.R is a Shiny tool which allows users to upload health intervention data (cost-effectiveness, cost of consumables, HR time commitment, target population) and customise a set of parameters (drug budget, size of health workforce, cost-effectiveness threshold, whether task-shifting is possible) to generate an HBP which maximises the health impact while being feasible within the resource constraints imposed. The app can be accessed [here](https://smohan.shinyapps.io/hbp-optimizer/). 

For the input data, the template provided needs to be used.
